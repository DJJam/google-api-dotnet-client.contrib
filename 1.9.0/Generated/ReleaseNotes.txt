===========================================

  1019: Issue 475: Pressing the back-button on WP crashes the application

  1018: Issue 471: Support Windows Phone 8.1 - Upgrade JSON.NET to 6.0.4 and update Portable projects to profile 328
  1017: Use profile 136 for now (everything compiles again)
  
  Need to investigate how can we support portable-net40+sl50+win+wpa81+wp80 (profile 328) for Newtonsoft.Json and Zlib.Portable.
  Both those packages are missing some configuration for profile 328.
  1016: Update projects to support profile 328 (for universal apps)
  1015: Issue 478: Update NuGet dependencies
